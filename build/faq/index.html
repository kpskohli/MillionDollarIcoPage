        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <h2>How does this work?</h2>
        <p>
          Here's a <a href="https://gfycat.com/BleakSimilarGermanspaniel">GIF!</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Is this an ICO?</h2>
        <p>
          No, but our aim is to showcase all ICO's out there on our web page.         </p>

       

        <h2>What do I get?</h2>
        <p>
          You get to buy a piece of blockchain history! At 0.001 ETH per pixel you can immortalize you ICO forever on the Ethereum blockchain.        </p>
               

        <h2>How long will this be up?</h2>
        <p>
          Your ad will be on the Ethereum blockchain forever! As long as someone somewhere is mining Ethereum, your little piece of blockchain history will endure too.
        </p>


        <h2>What happens when I buy an ad?</h2>
        <p>
          You’ll be able to publish a URL for an image and a URL that your ad links to. You can change them anytime you want as well! You can even transfer your ad to someone else.
        </p>


        <h2>Can we pay with currency we are about to ICO?</h2>
        <p>
          Sure you can, reach us at milliondollaricopage@gmail.com. You can pay us in your ICO currency equivalent to Ethers to post your ad.
        </p>


        <h2>Where are the images hosted?</h2>
        <p>
          The ad images are served to the user over HTTP, Swarm, or IPFS. You're responsibe for uploading them to a server or the Swarm or the IPFS network and providing the URL. You can also use a "data://" url, but this will cost you more gas to store. We do provide a periodic static cache of the (non-NSFW) images).
        </p>

        <h2>What will you do with the money?</h2>
        <p>Spend a lot of it and donate the rest. We'd like to fund cool projects if we can. Do you have any ideas? Email milliondollaricopage@gmail.com!</p>

        <h2>What if I want to advertise my socially-questionable business?</h2>
        <p>
          It’s the wild west out here so we can’t really stop you, but we do ask that you set the NSFW flag if the content you’re putting up is not appropriate for minors or illegal in western society. NSFW ads are not displayed by default.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can never take your ad away, but one right that we do reserve is to mark your ad as NSFW if we feel that it’s inappropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you mark your ad as NSFW, then you can always change it later. If we have to go in and override your ad to NSFW, then only we can change it to not-NSFW later. We don’t want to do it, but we don’t want to be liable for promoting questionable content.
        </p>

        <h2>What’s cool about your smart contract?</h2>
        <p>
          So glad you asked! Obviously, all the ad unit management happens on the blockchain. If you buy the ad slot, you own it forever (or until you transfer it to someone else).
        </p>
        <p>
          But to us, the the coolest thing is: It’s simple and easy to audit. It doesn’t do anything weird with complex pricing structures or use sneaky modifiers. Making something simple is hard, so don’t let it fool you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second best part? Simple means the fees are low. The most complicated thing you’ll do will only cost a dollar or two in fees, and you’re mostly paying for what you’re buying (storing your ad data on the blockchain) rather than complex middleware logic.
        </p>

        <h2>I'm convinced, how do I buy?</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="/">Head over to the homepage</a> and click 'Buy Pixels'. You'll need an Ethereum-enabled browser like
          <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases">Mist</a>,
          <a href="https://ethcore.io/parity.html">Parity</a>, or install the
          <a href="https://metamask.io">Metamask Chrome Extension</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you buy an ad unit, you're buying it directly from the smart
          contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It feels like magic every time.
